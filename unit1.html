      <h1> A Guide to Emergency Kits </h1>
    <p> In this modern era of urban civilization, many of us have lost touch with nature. We no longer
have the intimate knowledge of plants and their uses that our ancestors had acquired through
centuries of trial and error. When we want a cure for our headache or fever, we go not to the
meadow and woodland but to the drugstore.
The Medicinal Plant Garden of the Indiana Medical History Museum offers the opportunity to
remember that plants were the original source of most medicines. Many of the miracle drugs of
today are molecules or variations on compounds that were originally available from plant
medicines. For example, Bayer Aspirin (acetyl-salicylic acid) had its beginnings in 1897 from a
compound that occurs naturally in the herbaceous perennial European meadowsweet.
